### What is MelodyBot about?

<!-- need to add more to this description-->
The main purpose of MelodyBot is create a functional artificial intelligence which can generate music samples, with plans of songs in the future.  The music samples are based on the genre that is specified by the user.  The artificial intellingence is able to achieve this through neural networks that utilizes samples of the selected genre to assist in generating the music samples.  A secondary goal for MelodyBot is customer satisfaction.  In order to achieve this, MelodyBot needs to be consistent in creating music samples that match the genre that the users specified.  This goal can be achieved by improving the training in MelodyBotâ€™s neural network.

Currently, the neural network of MelodyBot prototype is able to generate music samples that are musical notes that are played at random beats.  Some of the samples are only five seconds, while other are as long as 20 to 30 seconds long.
